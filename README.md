# hw-responsive-portfolio

This week's homework we had to create a webpage using only Boostrap CSS. The page had to be responsive with media queries, as well as have working links between each page.

The Navbar and footer of the pages were relatively mirrored for each page.

The assignment had us play with a lot of positioning/flexbox/grid/floats to try and get our webpage to be responsive.
